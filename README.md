# Big2-Card-Game
A little Python project for a game I played since I was little.
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_two

This version of Big 2 utilizes what is known to me as the vietnamese way of playing:
- straights can vary from 3 cards to 13 cards
- chops (consecutive pairs)
- doubles
- full houses
- triples (3 of a kind)
- 4 of a kind
- suit order (from highest to lowest): Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades
- Spades of 3 starts
- no flushes/straight flushes
